Hypothesis :  Microsoft has gathered together a large number of incredibly useful and flexible software programmes into its portfolio available to the public.
These programmes are available in almost all the 'main' languages of the world, though US English is invariably the primary language of first issue of a programme.
The precision of English text employed in explanations of how the programme must be used is manifestly sub-optimal, creating confusion and wasted time.
Steps need to be taken to obviate this frequently occuring problem by employing competent staff who can recognise and correct ambiguous, confusing text.
This issue is very widespread, from Edge to almost every programme in Office.
Explanatory texts are frequently confusing, ambiguous and are not updated when changes are made to the way the programmes operate.
Although I believe that this issue is very widespread, there seem to be no metrics collected by Microsoft to ascertain the severity of the issue.
